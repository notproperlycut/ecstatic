1. Move validation to commands
1. "update" events (can remove uniqueness constraints?)
1. primary keys, names/ids, names are strings
1. handle errors from invocations
1. read model tests
1. top-level API `Ecstatic.application("demo").configure(config)`, `Ecstatic.application("demo").commands()`
1. use query types (that are not the projection types)
1. timeout (process manager?) unlocks the entitycomponent
1. errors from handlers disable the component, component configuration update enables the component
1. clients can wait on command invocation, clients can retry command invocation

Notes:
- require :already_seen_event ?
